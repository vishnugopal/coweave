    Anaka quietly ascends the staircase, trying to make as little noise as possible. As she reaches the top, she spots the guard with his back turned. She clears her throat to get his attention, and the guard spins around, his eyes narrowing at her.

    Before he can react further, Anaka quickly produces the gem and holds it out. "Wait! I have something you might want," she says, holding the gem up in the moonlight.

    The guard eyes the gem, then looks at Anaka. He hesitates for a moment, then nods. "Alright, hand it over. I didn't see anything," he mutters, pocketing the gem and stepping aside.

    With the guard no longer posing a threat, Anaka can continue on her way.

    Armed with the dagger, Anaka feels a bit more secure as she moves forward.

But if you have anything valuable, like more gems or information, that might catch their interest. Otherwise, your best chance is to avoid being seen altogether."

The right seems to lead to a dead-end with more cells, but to the left, she can see some sort of office with an open door leading to the moonlight outside. There is a man there, who looks up as Anaka walks in. He seems to be drunk.

    The drunken man blinks in confusion, trying to process what she just said. He drunkenly laughs, clearly amused but not taking her threat seriously. "A dragon, huh? Well, I don't want to be dragon food!" he chuckles, then points lazily toward the door leading outside. "That way, just go... and keep your dragon away from me!"

    With the guard's laughter echoing behind her, Anaka takes the opportunity to hastily make her way toward the exit.
